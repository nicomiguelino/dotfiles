# dotfiles

Feel free to check my collections of configs used in various tools I use. This repo is inspired by Nick Janetakis' [dotfiles](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles), so you might've noticed that I've copied ***some*** words from his README.md.

## Syncing (from local to remote)

Just run `./copy.sh` in your terminal (for Linux and macOS users) to update the configs in this repo.
