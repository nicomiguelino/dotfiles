# dotfiles

Feel free to check my collections of configs used in various tools I use. This repo is inspired by Nick Janetakis' [dotfiles](https://github.com/nickjj/dotfiles), so you might've noticed that I've copied ***some*** words from his README.md.

Here are the config files that I've been maintaining so far &mdash; `.vimrc`, `.tmux.conf`, `init.vim` (for Neovim), and `nicomiguelino.sh` &mdash; a common file used by `.zshrc` and `.bashrc`.


## Syncing

Just run `./copy.sh` in your terminal (for Linux and macOS users) to update the configs in this repo.
